# Getting Started

## Setup

1. Install [OpenGolfSim Desktop](/opengolfsim-desktop)<br>
    
    OpenGolfSim mobile requires [OpenGolfSim Desktop](/opengolfsim-desktop) to be installed and running on the PC you run GSPro on. The desktop app is needed to receive button commands over the network from OpenGolfSim and route them to GSPro.

2. Launch the **OpenGolfSim** app on your mobile device. Login to your OpenGolfSim account. (Creating an account helpsÂ us protect unauthorized devices from discovering or connecting to your host computer)

3. Click the **Connect to OpenGolfSim** follow the on screen instructions to automatically find and connect to the host computer on your local network. Once you see the desktop computer listed in the discovered devices, click the click **Connect**.
    Note: If you have trouble with this step, don't hesitate to reach out to our support team. 

4. Once connected you should see the default button controls and you should now be able to send button commands to the host computer from the mobile app!
