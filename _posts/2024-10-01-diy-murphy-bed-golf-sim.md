I'm now in my 3rd year of golf sim-ing in my garage. The first year I purchased my Garmin R10 and a cheap golf net off Amazon. Eventually I added a cheap projector and a $20 Walmart projector screen that I zip tied to the net. While this worked pretty well, it wasn't very secure or pretty. It also allowed bad shanks to fly around the garage.

Last year, I decided to step my game up a little, and I built a basic hitting bay out of sports nets and EMT piping. I used [the guide from GunghoGolf's blog](https://gunghogolf.com/blogs/simulators/how-to-build-your-own-diy-impact-screen-enclosure-for-your-golf-simulator-studio) as a starting point. The hardest part was stitching the nets together. I used 550 paracord and painstakingly weaved it to join the nets at the edges.

Now I'm in my third year of my garage golf sim and decided to pull out all the stops. My biggest gripe with having the simulator was that I couldn't use my garage while it was up. It just took up too much space. I saw [this company](https://www.murphygolfsimulators.com/dimensions) was making murphy-bed style folding simulators. This seemed like the perfect thing, but they ain't cheap. I figured I could design and build one myself for a fraction of the price.

> Finished space!

#TODO: I still need to add some hinges and a hoist to pull the flooring up into the cabinet, but once I was able to start playing rounds on it, it got very hard to finish those last few last bits.

If you're on the fence about building a sim, GO FOR IT! Cheers!
