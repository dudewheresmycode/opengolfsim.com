OpenGolfSim is the central platform that ties together your golf simulator setupâ€”bringing control, customization, and convenience into one unified experience. At the heart of it is OpenGolfSim Desktop, a Windows-based application that connects your hardware (like a control box), mobile devices, and optional features such as video replay, shot tracking, and analytics to level up your golf sim experience.

It runs quietly in the background as a service, ready to respond to your inputs and streamline gameplay. Whether you're using a tablet to trigger mulligans or reviewing your last shot in slow motion, OpenGolfSim keeps everything talking to each other. This documentation walks you through installation, setup, and troubleshooting to get everything working smoothly.
