# Control

You can use OpenGolfSim to control your golf sim gameplay two different ways. Either using our virtual control box via our mobile app, or with physical boxes by configuring a joystick or gamepad device.

## Mobile App

Controlling GSPro using our mobile app is the easiest way to get started. Once installed, the mobile app will automatically scan your local network for the computer running our desktop app. Once connected, it will instantly send button presses to GSPro. Aim your shots, take mulligans, drops and more. To get started, download from the iOS App Store or Google Play.

## Physical Box

You can also connect a gamepad or joystick device to your desktop PC to use a prebuilt or DIY physical control box. Learn more about programming a physical control box.
