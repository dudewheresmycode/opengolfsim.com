## Download & Installation

To get started, download the latest release of OpenGolfSim Desktop on the same PC where you run GSPro.

1. Go to our [downloads page](https://opengolfsim.com/account/downloads).
2. If you don’t already have an account, you’ll be prompted to create one. Otherwise, log in with your existing credentials.
3. Once signed in, return to the [downloads page](https://opengolfsim.com/account/downloads).
4. Click **Download** next to the latest version of OpenGolfSim Desktop.

Save the installer to your PC and run it to begin setup.

> You may see a **"Windows protected your PC"** popup. This is expected while we finalize Microsoft code signing for our application.

Click **More Info**, then select **Run anyway** to continue.

## First Launch & Setup

After installation, OpenGolfSim will launch automatically and appear as a new icon in your Windows taskbar. Here’s what happens next:

- **Firewall prompt (optional)**  
  On some systems, Windows may ask to allow access. Approve it so the app can communicate with GSPro, your control box, or mobile devices.

- **Runs in the background**  
  OpenGolfSim functions as a system service, staying out of the way while staying connected. To close OpenGolfSim Desktop select File then "Exit OpenGolfSim" or quit the app from the systems tray.

- **Account login required**  
  The first time you open the app, you’ll be prompted to log in with your OpenGolfSim account. This ties your settings and features to your profile.

- **Auto-updates**  
  The app will automatically check for updates and apply them in the background, so you’re always running the latest version.

Once signed in, you're ready to:

- Pair the mobile app and start using remote controls.
- Enable and test video replay features.
- Configure GSPro settings (see the [GSPro Settings](https://help.opengolfsim.com/desktop/gspro-settings.html) page).
- Start a round and play.
