## Download & Installation

To get started, download the latest release from our [downloads page](https://sandbox.opengolfsim.com/account/downloads) on the same PC where you run GSPro.

Once downloaded, run the `OpenGolfSim-x.x.x Setup.exe` installer from your downloads folder.

!!! warning
    You may see a **"Windows protected your PC"** popup. This is expected while we finalize Microsoft code signing for our application.

    Click **More Info**, then select **Run anyway** to continue.
