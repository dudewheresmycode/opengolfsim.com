# GSPro Settings

Some button actions on the control box or mobile app require settings to be enabled in GSPro before they'll function correctly. If these features aren't turned on, corresponding buttons (like Mulligan or Aim) won’t do anything in-game.

This page shows how to enable the most commonly used features so everything works as expected.

## Mulligan Button: Enabling Mulligan Functionality

To make sure the mulligan button works during a round:

1. Launch any course in GSPro (this setting only appears once a course is loaded).
2. Go to **Settings > Round Settings > Mulligan**.
3. Set **Mulligans** to **Yes**.
4. Save and exit.

{: .note }
> If you don’t load a course first, you won’t see the mulligan setting in the menu.

## Additional Suggestions: Optimizing Visual Feedback

These tweaks help you get better on-screen feedback when using distance-related controls:

1. Stay in **Settings > Visual Settings**.
2. Enable **DISTANCE DISPLAY**.
3. Set the display location to **UP** for easier visibility during play.
4. Save and exit.
