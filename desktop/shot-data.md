# Shot Data & Export

OpenGolfSim Desktop can parse shot data from GSPro in real-time, allowing you to review and save detailed shot history after a round. This is especially useful for tracking progress, identifying patterns, or analyzing performance across sessions.

{: .note }
> Shots that complete a hole do not register as shot data in GSPro. We're working on a solution to this, but currently the final shot of each hole won’t be captured.

## What Gets Tracked

The app stores all shot data that GSPro provides between the tee and the last shot before the cup. This includes:

- Ball Speed
- Club Speed
- Angel of Attach  
- Carry
- Horizontal Launch Angle (HLA)
- Vertical Launch Angle (VLA)
- Loft
- Back Spin
- Side Spin 
- and more! 

This information is stored locally on your PC and tied to your OpenGolfSim account.

**Radar-Based Launch Monitors with GSPro – Accuracy Summary**

Keep in mind radar-based launch monitors like the Garmin R10 measure basic data such as club and ball speed, but rely on calculations for key metrics like spin, carry distance, and shot shape. When used with GSPro, much of the ball data is estimated, not directly measured.

## Viewing Shot History

You can view past shots in the **Shot Data** section of the desktop app:

After installing OpenGolfSim be sure to **enable** the Collect Shot Data option from the Shot Data tab.
