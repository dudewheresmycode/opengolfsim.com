# Shot Data

OpenGolfSim Desktop can parse shot data from GSPro to allow you to review and save your shot data after a round.

{: .note }
> Shots that complete a hole do not register as shot data in GSPro. We're working on a solution to this, but currently the last shot of any hole will not be captured.


## Export

You can export your shot data as a CSV file, which can be useful if you want to analyze the data in a spreadsheet or external tool.
