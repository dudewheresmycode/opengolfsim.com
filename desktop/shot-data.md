# Shot Data & Export

OpenGolfSim Desktop can parse shot data from GSPro in real-time, allowing you to review and save detailed shot history after a round. This is especially useful for tracking progress, identifying patterns, or analyzing performance across sessions.

{: .note }
> Shots that complete a hole do not register as shot data in GSPro. We're working on a solution to this, but currently the final shot of each hole won’t be captured.

## What Gets Tracked

The app stores all shot data that GSPro provides between the tee and the last shot before the cup. This includes:

- Hole number
- Shot 
- Club index  
- Distance 
- Horizontal Launch Angle  
- Vertical Launch Angle  
- Speed 
- Hole result 

This information is stored locally on your PC and tied to your OpenGolfSim account.

1. Go to the **Shot Data** tab
2. Click **Export CSV**
4. Choose a location on your PC to save the file

## Coming Soon
